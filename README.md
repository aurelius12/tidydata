## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

* The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
### Objectives
* a tidy data set as a text file called tidydataset.txt
* a link to a Github repository with a script for performing the analysis, called  run_analysis.R
* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
